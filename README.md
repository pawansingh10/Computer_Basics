#### **BUS**
- A Bus is a collection of parallel wires that forms a pathway to carry address, data and control signals.

* The features of BUSes are :
 
 - A bus is set of wires and each wire can carry 1 bit of data
 
 - A bus width is defined by numbers of wires in the bus
 
* BUSes are generally of two types :
 
 - **1. Internal BUS**
 - It connects major computer components like Processor, Memory and I/O 
 
 - Also known as ***System Bus***
 
 
 - **2. External BUS**
  
 - It connects the different external devices peripherals, expansion slots, I/O ports to rest of computer
 
 - Also known as ***Expansion Bus***

> ***External Bus is slower compare to internal bus***

* System Bus or Expansion Bus is comprises of three Buses

- **1. Address Bus**
  - It connects CPU and RAM with a set of line similar to data bus
  
  - The address bus Width determines the maximum number of memory location the computer can address


- **2. Data Bus**
  - It provides a path to transfer data between CPU and Memory
  
  - The data bus may be consist of 32, 64, 128 lines of wire 

-  **3. Control Bus**
  - It is used to control the access and the use of data and address line



####  **SMPS - Switch Mode Power Supply**

- SMPS converts AC power from Electical outlet to DC power need by system components

- SMPS contain power card pluf, fan for cooling because it generates a lot of heat


##### **UPS - Uninterrupted Power Supply**

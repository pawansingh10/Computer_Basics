Generic Terms and Definitions


### Computer
***
* ***Computer is an electronic device that can store, recall, process data and perform tasks or complex calculations according to the sets of instructions.***
  
1. **Hardware**
    - Hardware, basically physical parts of device.
    - Keyboard, Mouse, Desktop, RAM, CPU, HardDisk
  
2. **Software**
    - **Software** is basically a set of computer **programs**.
    - **Programs** is basically a set of **instructions**.
    - When the program is in execution, this is known as **Process**
     
  - ***1. System Software***
     - Operating System
     - Windows, Linux, Mac-OS, Android etc
      
  -  ***2. Application Software***
     - Social-Media Apps
     - LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram etc
     - Commercial Apps
     - Amazon, FlipCart, IRCTC etc
  
 3. **Data**   
     - Everything is data
     - Raw Information
     - > ***Data about Data is known as Meta-Data***
  
 4. **Users**
     - Users is consumers of services
   




### Computer is basically designed by using these
***

1. **Input Unit**
   - Computer need to receive instructions and data in order to solve a problem
   - Input Unit basically links the external world or environment to computer
   - It consists of devices
   - Keyboard, Mouse, Mic etc


2. **Central Processing Unit** CPU
   - CPU interpret the instruction in program and execute them one by one.
   - **1. Control Unit** CU
    - Transfer & Redirect **program instructions** and **data** from various units  
   - **2. Arithmetic & Logic Unit** ALU
    - Performs **Arithmetical & Logical Operations** and control the speed of these operations
      
      
3. **Memory Unit**
   - The instructions and data that has to be process or the result that has been generated after processing needs to be store and where it stores is **Memory**
   - A computer memory is refers to as electonic storing space for instructions and data.
   
   
### ***Primary Memory or Main Memory***
   - Stores program and data i.e currently needed by CPU

#### ***RAM***
   - Random Access Memory
   - Voilatile
   - Tempory store if power cutt
   - Fast
   - |SRAM|DRAM|
     |-----|-----|
     |Static RAM | Dynamic RAM|
     |Used in Cache due to its high speed| Uses Transistor and Capacitor|
     |More Expensive| Cheaper & Consume less power|
   - SDRAM vs DDR RAM
   - SDRAM stands for **Synchronous Dynamic** RAM
   - DDR RAM stands for **Double Data Rate** RAM
   - It works as SD RAM but the data transfer rate is double compare to SD RAM
   - DDR RAM - **DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4**


#### ***ROM***
   - Read Only Memory
   - Non volatile
   - Permanent store even if power shut-down
   - Slow compare to RAM
      
      
### ***Secondary Memory or External Memory***
   - In secondary Memory Data is first transfer to Main Memory and then routed to processing Unit
   - Information/Data stored is permanent unless intensionally deleted | Non Volatile
   - Little Slow in interacting with MicroProcessor
   - Examples - Magnetic tape, optical disks, floppy disc, punch-card, flash memory(USB drives)
    
    
### ***Cache Memory***
   - Cache Memory is high speed memory placed between CPU and RAM.
   - Cache Memory stores data that is used more often, temporarily stored them and make available for CPU at fast rate
   - Increase Speed of Processing
   - Expensive thats why small in size 256KB, 512KB, 2MB, 4MB, 8MB
      
##### ***L1 Cache***
   - Extremely FastRelatively Small
   - 32KB to 512KB
   - Present Inside CPU
      
##### ***L2 Cache***
   - High Speed
   - 1MB to 2MB
   - Located outside the CPU interconnected with CPU
       
##### ***L3 Cache***
   - Improve the performence
   - Improve working of L1 and L2
   - It usually double the RAM Speed


4. **Output Unit**
   - It is use to print or display the result, which are stored in memory after processing
   - Output units links the computer to outside world
   - Devices like Monitor, Speaker, Printer etc
   


### Understanding of Configuration of your Laptop and Desktop
***
  - Configuration simply means arrangement of the hardware and software of a system.
  
#### Desktop or Laptop Configuration
- **Assembled**
  - Components are of differents brands
  - Intel-Core, HP Desktop, Acer etc
- **BrandWise**
  - All the components belongs to same brand
  - Dell
  
- ***Processors***
  
  - **Core-i3** 2cpu 2MB cache-l2
  
  - **Core-i5** 4cpu 4MB cache-l2
  
  - **Core-i7** 8cpu 8Mb cache-l2
  
  - **Core-i9** 10cpu 12MB cache-l2
  
  - Core basically means multiple CPUs
  
  - Quad-core, Hexa-Core, Octa-core
  
  - **Cache Memory**, increase the perdormance & response time
  
  - **Frequency**, the number of instruction cycles executed per second ***1.60GHz   1.80 GHz***
  
- ***RAM***
  - DDR4 4GB/8GB/12GB/16GB

- ***ROM***
  - **SSD** and **HDD**
  
  - Solid State Drive is expensive and very fast compare to HDD  SSD 128GB/256GB/521GB
  
  - Hard Disk Drive is cheap and slow  HDD 512GB/1TB/2TB/5TB
  
- ***Graphics card***

  - Improve the resolution and quality of screen or display

  - Mainly Used for better experience in Gaming and Editing

- ***Monitor***

  - Size of Screen - 12 inches/15 inches/ 24 inches
  
  - Resolution 1024x768p / 1920x1080p


- ***Operating System***
  
  - DOS/Windows/Linux/Mac-OS/Android
  
  - DOS means Empty No OS you need to buy or purchase OS for your device
  
  - Some systems has preinstalled Windows10 Genuine on the device cost extra 5k to 7k
  
  - Windows10 is paid
  
  - Linux is free
   
- ***Ports***
  - How many ports are available on the system
  
  - **USB-Ports** with their speed 2.0/3.0
  
  - **HDMI-Ports** 2.0/3.0
  
  - **MemoryCard-Ports** 2.0/3.0
